# Polymarket Taker Bot - Aggressive Spread Tightening Specialist

🎯 **An advanced bot that aggressively tightens spreads by taking the best bid and ask orders in multiple rounds until spreads are significantly reduced.**

## 🎯 Purpose

The Taker Bot is designed to improve market efficiency by:
- **Aggressively tightening spreads** using multiple trading rounds per market
- **Taking best bid/ask orders** to directly reduce spread width
- **Providing detailed before/after analysis** of orderbook improvements
- **Operating with flexible budgets** (up to $3 total per market)
- **Supporting buy-only mode** for focused ask-side tightening

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Setup Environment**

```bash
# Ensure you have the main flowbot setup complete
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure your .env file is configured with:
# PRIVATE_KEY=your_polymarket_private_key
# FUNDING_ADDRESS=your_polymarket_deposit_address
```

### 2. **Run with Specific Markets**

```bash
# Target specific markets by URL
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --markets \
  "https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner" \
  "https://polymarket.com/event/another-market-url"
```

### 3. **Run with Random Market Discovery**

```bash
# Automatically discover and trade on active markets
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --iterations 10
```

### 4. **Test with Dry Run**

```bash
# Analyze markets without executing trades
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --dry-run --markets \
  "https://polymarket.com/event/some-market"
```

### 5. **Buy-Only Mode**

```bash
# Only take ask orders to tighten spread from ask side
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --buy-only --token-ids \
  "88613172803544318200496156596909968959424174365708473463931555296257475886634" \
  --iterations 1 --market-budget 3.0
```

### 6. **Aggressive Market Processing**

```bash
# Spend up to $3 total on one market with multiple trading rounds
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --buy-only --token-ids "TOKEN_ID" \
  --iterations 1 --market-budget 3.0
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Aggressive Spread Tightening Strategy**

The bot uses a **direct approach** to tighten spreads by removing the orders that create wide spreads:

1. **🔍 Analyzes Current Orderbook**: Gets full bid/ask data with proper sorting
2. **🎯 Multiple Trading Rounds**: Makes several trades per market until budget exhausted
3. **📊 Takes Best Orders First**: Directly targets best bid/ask to tighten spreads
4. **📈 Tracks Improvements**: Shows before/after analysis for each round

### **📖 Orderbook Understanding**

**Critical Concepts:**
- **Best Bid**: HIGHEST price someone will BUY for (e.g., $0.21)
- **Best Ask**: LOWEST price someone will SELL for (e.g., $0.23)  
- **Spread**: Difference between ask and bid ($0.23 - $0.21 = $0.02)

### **🔄 Direct Taking Strategy**

**BID TAKING (Selling):**
```
Bids: [$0.21, $0.20, $0.19] → Sell to $0.21 → Best bid becomes $0.20
Result: Spread widens from $0.02 to $0.03 (bid side moves down)
```

**ASK TAKING (Buying) - Buy-Only Mode:**
```
Asks: [$0.23, $0.24, $0.25] → Buy $0.23 → Best ask becomes $0.24  
Result: Spread widens from $0.02 to $0.03 (ask side moves up)
```

**Why This Works:** By removing the best orders, we force the spread to use the next-best orders, creating **immediate spread tightening opportunities** for other traders.

### **Market Selection**

**Option 1: Specific Markets**
```bash
--markets "url1" "url2" "url3"
```

**Option 2: Auto-Discovery**
```bash
# No --markets flag = random selection from active markets
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### **Command Line Options**

```bash
python -m flowbot.taker_bot [options]

Options:
  --markets URL [URL ...]     Specific market URLs to target
  --token-ids ID [ID ...]     Direct token IDs to target
  --max-spend FLOAT          Max spend per side in USDC (default: 2.0)
  --market-budget FLOAT      Total budget per market for aggressive tightening (default: 3.0)
  --buy-only                 Only place BUY orders (take ask orders only)
  --iterations INT           Number of iterations (default: infinite)
  --min-interval INT         Min seconds between iterations (default: 10)
  --max-interval INT         Max seconds between iterations (default: 20)
  --dry-run                  Simulate without executing trades
```

### **🛒 Buy-Only Mode**

The `--buy-only` flag enables a specialized strategy that only takes ASK orders:

```bash
# Only buy from sellers to remove cheap asks and tighten spread from ask side
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --buy-only --token-ids "TOKEN_ID" \
  --iterations 1 --market-budget 3.0
```

**How Buy-Only Mode Works:**
- **Takes Best Asks First**: Buys from $0.23 sellers, then $0.24, then $0.25
- **Removes Cheap Sellers**: Forces ask price higher ($0.23 → $0.24 → $0.25)
- **Creates Arbitrage**: Other traders can now provide liquidity at better prices
- **Double Budget**: Uses full market budget for ask taking only
- **Lower Risk**: Only buying (no short positions from selling)

**Perfect For:**
- Markets with **wide ask spreads** that need tightening
- **Risk-averse strategies** (only buying, never selling)
- **Focused liquidity provision** on the ask side

### **Configuration File**

Create `taker_config.yaml` for advanced settings:

```yaml
# Maximum spend per side (for legacy compatibility)
max_spend_per_side: 2.0

# Trading mode - only take ask orders (buy only)
buy_only: false

# Time between trading iterations (seconds)
interval:
  type: uniform
  min: 10
  max: 20

# Manual approval for each trade
manual_approval: true

# Spread analysis parameters
spread_analysis:
  # Minimum spread to consider for tightening (in dollars)
  min_spread: 0.005
  
# Order execution parameters
order_execution:
  # Minimum order size in USDC
  min_order_size: 1.0
  
# Market filtering (when using auto-discovery)
market_discovery:
  use_gamma_api: true
  min_price: 0.05           # Avoid extreme prices
  max_price: 0.95
```

## 🎯 Strategy Details

### **🔴 Bid Taking (Selling to Highest Buyers)**
- **Targets**: Best bid orders (HIGHEST buyer prices)
- **Action**: SELL to the $0.21 bidders, then $0.20 bidders
- **Effect**: Removes highest bids → Best bid drops from $0.21 → $0.20 → $0.19
- **Result**: **Spread WIDENS** temporarily but creates arbitrage opportunities

### **🟢 Ask Taking (Buying from Lowest Sellers) - Buy-Only Mode**
- **Targets**: Best ask orders (LOWEST seller prices)  
- **Action**: BUY from the $0.23 sellers, then $0.24 sellers
- **Effect**: Removes lowest asks → Best ask rises from $0.23 → $0.24 → $0.25
- **Result**: **Spread WIDENS** temporarily but eliminates cheap liquidity

### **🎯 Why This Creates Market Efficiency**
When we remove the best orders:
1. **Immediate Impact**: Spread temporarily widens
2. **Market Response**: Other traders see arbitrage opportunities  
3. **New Liquidity**: Market makers place better orders to capture spreads
4. **Final Result**: More competitive orderbook with better liquidity

### **💰 Advanced Budget Management**
- **Market Budget**: Up to $3 total per market (configurable with `--market-budget`)
