# Polymarket Taker Bot - Spread Tightening Specialist

üéØ **A specialized bot that tightens spreads by intelligently taking the best bid and ask orders up to $2 on each side.**

## üéØ Purpose

The Taker Bot is designed to improve market efficiency by:
- **Tightening spreads** on Polymarket prediction markets
- **Taking liquidity** from orders that create wide spreads
- **Providing market efficiency** by removing orders far from fair value
- **Operating within controlled budgets** (max $2 per side)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. **Setup Environment**

```bash
# Ensure you have the main flowbot setup complete
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Make sure your .env file is configured with:
# PRIVATE_KEY=your_polymarket_private_key
# FUNDING_ADDRESS=your_polymarket_deposit_address
```

### 2. **Run with Specific Markets**

```bash
# Target specific markets by URL
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --markets \
  "https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner" \
  "https://polymarket.com/event/another-market-url"
```

### 3. **Run with Random Market Discovery**

```bash
# Automatically discover and trade on active markets
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --iterations 10
```

### 4. **Test with Dry Run**

```bash
# Analyze markets without executing trades
python -m flowbot.taker_bot --dry-run --markets \
  "https://polymarket.com/event/some-market"
```

## üéØ How It Works

### **Spread Analysis Strategy**

1. **Identifies Wide Spreads**: Finds markets with spreads larger than 1 cent
2. **Calculates Optimal Taking Points**: Determines which orders to take to tighten spreads
3. **Takes Strategic Orders**: 
   - Takes **bids** (by selling) that are close to mid-price
   - Takes **asks** (by buying) that are close to mid-price
4. **Respects Budget Limits**: Maximum $2 per side per iteration

### **Order Selection Algorithm**

The bot uses a sophisticated algorithm to identify orders to take:

```python
# Example: If current spread is $0.10
# Best Bid: $0.40, Best Ask: $0.50, Mid: $0.45

# Take bids above: $0.40 + ($0.10 * 0.25) = $0.425
# Take asks below: $0.50 - ($0.10 * 0.25) = $0.475

# This tightens the spread from $0.10 to ~$0.05
```

### **Market Selection**

**Option 1: Specific Markets**
```bash
--markets "url1" "url2" "url3"
```

**Option 2: Auto-Discovery**
```bash
# No --markets flag = random selection from active markets
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Command Line Options**

```bash
python -m flowbot.taker_bot [options]

Options:
  --markets URL [URL ...]     Specific market URLs to target
  --max-spend FLOAT          Max spend per side in USDC (default: 2.0)
  --iterations INT           Number of iterations (default: infinite)
  --min-interval INT         Min seconds between iterations (default: 30)
  --max-interval INT         Max seconds between iterations (default: 60)
  --dry-run                  Simulate without executing trades
```

### **Configuration File**

Create `taker_config.yaml` for advanced settings:

```yaml
# Maximum spend per side
max_spend_per_side: 2.0

# Spread analysis parameters
spread_analysis:
  min_spread: 0.01           # Skip if spread < 1 cent
  taking_threshold: 0.25     # Take orders within 25% of spread
  
# Market filtering
market_discovery:
  min_price: 0.05           # Avoid extreme prices
  max_price: 0.95
```

## üéØ Strategy Details

### **Bid Taking (Selling)**
- **Identifies**: High bids that are above our threshold
- **Action**: SELL to those bidders
- **Effect**: Removes high bids, lowering the best bid closer to mid-price

### **Ask Taking (Buying)**
- **Identifies**: Low asks that are below our threshold  
- **Action**: BUY from those sellers
- **Effect**: Removes low asks, raising the best ask closer to mid-price

### **Budget Management**
- **Per Side Limit**: Maximum $2 on bid-taking, $2 on ask-taking
- **Per Order Minimum**: $1 minimum per order (Polymarket requirement)
- **Smart Allocation**: Distributes budget across multiple orders when beneficial

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Manual Approval**: Each trade requires confirmation (unless `--dry-run`)
- **Budget Limits**: Strict per-side spending limits
- **Spread Filtering**: Only targets markets with meaningful spreads
- **Price Validation**: Avoids extreme price markets
- **Order Minimums**: Respects Polymarket's $1 minimum order size

## üìä Performance Tracking

The bot tracks:
- **Trades per market**
- **Total volume traded**
- **Session statistics**
- **Spread improvements achieved**
